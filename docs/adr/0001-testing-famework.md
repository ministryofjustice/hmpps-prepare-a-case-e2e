# Architectural Decision Record (ADR)  
## ADR-001: Adoption of Playwright for End-to-End (E2E) Testing  

### Status  
**Proposed**  

### Context  
The project requires a robust, scalable, and modern end-to-end (E2E) testing framework to validate the integrity of user flows and system interactions. This decision is informed by the following factors:  

1. **Existing End-to-End Codebase:**  
   A current E2E testing project within the organisation uses Playwright, offering reusable components and code snippets. Leveraging this codebase reduces the effort required to build a new testing framework from scratch.  

2. **Industry Recognition:**  
   Playwright is a modern testing framework that supports multiple browsers and devices, including Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. It is well-suited for testing complex front-end and back-end interactions. Furthermore, Playwright is listed on the organisation's tech radar, indicating alignment with strategic technology initiatives and future-proofing.  

3. **Ease of Use and Maintenance:**  
   Playwright provides developer-friendly features, such as auto-waiting, built-in test runners, and detailed trace viewer debugging. Its robust API allows for consistent test execution and simplified maintenance.  

4. **Modern Features:**  
   - **Cross-Browser Support:** Ensures tests can run across all major browsers with a single configuration.  
   - **Parallel Test Execution:** Reduces runtime for large test suites.  
   - **Network Interception:** Allows for precise simulation of back-end responses, enabling comprehensive testing of front-end and API interactions.  

5. **Alignment with QA Objectives:**  
   Playwright integrates seamlessly with Postman automation and supports reusable data-seeding mechanisms via tools like Faker. It aligns with the QA resource’s mandate to create reusable and automated testing solutions.  

6. **Community and Support:**  
   Playwright has a growing community, detailed documentation, and frequent updates, making it a reliable choice for both short-term and long-term testing strategies.  

### Decision  
Playwright will be adopted as the E2E testing library for the project. The following implementation strategy will be employed:  

1. **Leverage Existing Codebase:**  
   Identify and extract reusable components and tests from the current Playwright project within the organisation to accelerate development.  

2. **Establish Best Practices:**  
   Define consistent coding standards, folder structures, and reusable utilities to ensure maintainability and ease of onboarding.  

3. **Integrate with CI/CD Pipelines:**  
   Ensure Playwright tests are automated as part of the CI/CD pipelines to provide rapid feedback on system integrity.  

4. **Enhance QA Processes:**  
   Use Playwright's built-in debugging tools and tracing capabilities to streamline the QA resource’s efforts in creating reliable E2E tests.  

### Consequences  
**Positive Impacts:**  
- Accelerated development due to reuse of existing Playwright code.  
- Standardisation across teams by adopting a tech radar-aligned tool.  
- Reduced maintenance overhead due to Playwright’s built-in automation and modern features.  
- Better test coverage across multiple browsers and devices.  

**Trade-Offs:**  
- Initial learning curve for team members unfamiliar with Playwright.  
- Potential migration effort if organisational priorities shift away from Playwright in the future.  

### Alternatives Considered  
1. **Cypress:**  
   While Cypress is a popular testing framework, it has limited cross-browser support compared to Playwright. It was deemed less aligned with the organisation’s tech radar and existing resources.  

2. **Selenium:**  
   Selenium is a mature tool but lacks the modern features and performance optimisations of Playwright. Its verbose setup and slower test execution were significant drawbacks.  

3. **No Change:**  
   Continuing without a dedicated E2E testing framework would compromise the quality assurance goals and lead to ad hoc testing processes.  

### Next Steps  
- **Onboard Team:** Provide training sessions or documentation for team members new to Playwright.  
- **Codebase Assessment:** Identify reusable components in the existing Playwright project and integrate them into the new framework.  
- **Infrastructure Setup:** Configure Playwright for cross-browser testing and integrate it with CI/CD pipelines.  
- **Data-Seeding Mechanism:** Build reusable test data seeding using Faker and validate it with Playwright and Postman.
